   deliberatic.com — the build.

       node build-site.mjs        (or: npm run build)

   records/surface.json  →  build-site.mjs  →  index.html
                                  ↑
                       the band, the status block and every call to
                       action are EMITTED from the record. They are not
                       typed into the template, so a rung, a scope or a
                       verb cannot drift from what the record says.

   SHELL.md §4.1: a page cell must be computed, and the record is what it is
   checked against. If the page is the source, nothing can audit it.

   §3 is the load-bearing part: the verb table is code, and a call to action
   the rung has not earned does not get emitted at all. The build refuses
   rather than warning.


   DEPLOYING THIS (SHELL.md §4.4). The artifact is generated and COMMITTED, so
   a Cloudflare Pages project that serves the repository root with no build
   command keeps working exactly as it does today. That is deliberate: it
   changes nothing about how this domain is served.

   The stronger arrangement is to set the Pages build command to
   `npm run test:launch`, which regenerates index.html AND re-proves it before
   Cloudflare is allowed to serve it. A plain `npm run build` would deploy an
   unproven artifact. The build command is only settable in the Cloudflare
   dashboard, which is why it is written down here. [TRAVIS]

   No dependencies. No network.
