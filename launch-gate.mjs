   rung has not earned; this refuses on the other ways a page lies: a rung
   invented, a scope quietly widened, a citation that resolves to nothing, a
   dead mailbox, an animation constant published as a fact, a caveat printed
   at a contrast nobody can read.

   A GATE NOBODY HAS SEEN REFUSE IS AN OPINION. Every check here was broken

   2b. The retraction CONFINES what it retracts — counted, not detected
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SHELL.md r6, hole 1. The old check asked "is the retraction present?" and
   stopped. Presence is not the property. A page could KEEP its retraction and
   reinstate the retracted sentence anywhere else on the page and pass — a
   real deliberate break report did exactly that, which is why this lane's
   earlier "44 breaks forced, 44 refused" is an upper bound and not a proof.

   CONFINEMENT is the property. Every needle is counted in the raw artifact
   AND in the extracted text, and every occurrence must fall inside the
   retraction region; `max_total` additionally bounds the count so the
   retraction cannot be padded with reinstated copies of what it retracts.
   Both spaces are counted because a needle can be written as an entity in one
   and read as a character in the other.

   The region is extracted by BALANCED DEPTH. A non-greedy match to the first
   </div> would silently truncate the region if a <div> were ever nested in
   it — the counter would then read part of the retraction as "outside" and
   refuse. That is the safe direction, but a check that is right for the wrong
   reason stops being right when the markup changes.

           The obvious implementation of r6 is `onPage === insideRetraction`:
           every occurrence accounted for inside the retraction. It is still
           defective, and a sibling lane watched it approve a lie. The
           retraction is authored content, so an equality lets the blocklisted
           sentence repeat WITHOUT LIMIT inside it — on agentelic.com it was
           appended three times, putting the retracted claim on the artifact
           four times, and the gate reported 114 passed, 0 refused.

           So: outside must be 0, AND inside is bounded by a literal from the
           record, AND the two are separate checks. The general rule is r10's:
           a check whose two sides are both under the author's control is not
           a check. `max_total` is a number someone has to raise on purpose, in
           a diff, with a reason — not a quantity the page can re-derive by
           editing itself.

           HIDDEN occurrences are refused outright rather than bounded. A
           needle that is in the markup but not in the rendered text is in a
           comment or a non-rendering attribute; it is not a retraction and it
           is not visible, so there is no count at which it is acceptable. */

   13. Every .btn keeps its own ink — THE CASCADE IS RESOLVED, NOT ASSUMED
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SHELL.md r7/r8. `.top nav a` is specificity 0,2,1 and `.btn` is 0,1,0, so
   an unscoped nav rule WINS and a call to action inside the header paints
   --fg2 on --acc — washed-out light on a saturated accent — while the
   identical button in the hero paints correctly.

   Nothing we ran caught it, and §11 is the reason: the contrast maths reads
   DECLARED TOKENS. The pair it checks is the pair the button was supposed to
   have. The token was always fine; the element never received it. That is why
   44 forced breaks did not catch this one.

   So this resolves the cascade over the ARTIFACT instead. For every element
   carrying .btn: find every rule that matches it and declares `color`, take
   the winner by (!important, specificity, source order), and refuse unless
   the winner is itself a rule whose rightmost compound carries .btn.

   It FAILS CLOSED. A selector the parser does not understand, a second
   stylesheet, a colour inside an @media — any of them and this refuses rather
   than reports a verdict it cannot stand behind. The verdicts were
   cross-checked against a real browser's getComputedStyle for every .btn on
   the page; they agreed on every one.

   this checks the record's own arithmetic, checks the recorded line-height
   clears the requirement, and checks the EMITTED stylesheet still carries
   that line-height. A value edited in the CSS without re-measuring refuses.

   15. The artifact came from THIS build

   SHELL.md r6, hole 2. Nothing proved it. If build-site.mjs threw, the

   a page nobody had just produced from the sources beside it. A real
   deliberate break report PASSED on exactly that.

   Output digests alone do not close it: after a failed build the old manifest
   and the old artifact still agree with each other. So the manifest binds the
   INPUTS as well, and a source that has moved on since the artifact was
   written is the definition of stale.
