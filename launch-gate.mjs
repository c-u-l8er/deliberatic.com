   It reads the ARTIFACT — the emitted index.html and identity.js — not the

   thing worth checking. The build already refuses to emit a call to action a
   rung has not earned; this refuses on the other ways a page lies: a rung
   invented, a scope quietly widened, a citation that resolves to nothing, a
   dead mailbox, an animation constant published as a fact, a caveat printed
   at a contrast nobody can read.

   A GATE NOBODY HAS SEEN REFUSE IS AN OPINION. Every check here was broken
   deliberately once and watched to fail; the count is in the commit message.
