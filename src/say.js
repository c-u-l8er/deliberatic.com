   say.js — the contact form's upgrade, and nothing else.

   SHELL.md r9. Travis's ruling, 2026-08-17: contact is the ComputeDriven
   Formspree form. Fourteen surfaces were blocked on that endpoint and pointed
   corrections at GitHub issues instead; this replaces that as the primary
   channel and keeps the issues link as a second route.

   THE FORM WORKS WITHOUT THIS FILE. It is a real <form action method="POST">
   posting to Formspree, so with scripting off — the state this whole page is
   built to survive — pressing Send still delivers the message. All this adds
   is an inline reply, so the visitor is not handed to somebody else's
   thank-you screen.

   The one rule that matters: "sent" is printed ONLY after the endpoint
   returns 2xx. A form that says thank-you on submit and drops the message is
   precisely the failure the retraction on this page is about — the waitlist
   button changed its own label to "Added" and discarded the address. Doing
   that again, in JavaScript, would be the same lie with better manners.

   It touches the form and nothing else on the page. It is not the identity
   animation and must not become one: identity.js is forbidden from reading or
   writing page content, this file is confined to <form class="say">.
